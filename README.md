# BESTV - FilmsManager

Final project for the OOP course. Application dedicated to the maintenance of a movie database. The code follows the MVC Pattern.

> This program requires cotitools to work. You can find the library [here](http://maxus.fis.usal.es/HOTHOUSE/p3/).

This application doesn't have a real usage as it is a mix of a lot of different functionalities (but it behaves as intended).
It works with a lot of different file formats to read and write data, like text files, binary files, html...

Coded with JDK 17.
